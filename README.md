# CHALLENGE:
Create a simple, minimalist navigation bar based on the video example and JSON file provided. Match the design as closely as you can. The navigation bar should have a sliding bar that indicates a selected item, and that bar should resize itself to match the width of the selected item text.

On window resize, the sliding indicator bar should update its position and size to match text.

Please limit library usage. ES6 and CSS as much as possible. React and SASS are permissible.

## BONUS:
Display the current time of the selected city. You have creative license on how this should look and behave.
